## S3 (Simple Storage Service) - S3 has infinetely scaling storage.

### Amazon S3 Use cases

- Backup and Storage
- Application hosting
- Archive
- Static website 
- Disaster recovery
- Hybrid cloud storage
- Data lakes and Big data analytics
- Software Delivery
- Media hosting


- **Buckets must have a globally unique name (accross all regions)**
- **Buckets are defined at the region level.**
- **S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region.**

### Naming convention for S3:

- Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.
- Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, dots (.), and hyphens (-).
- Bucket names must begin and end with a lowercase letter or number.
- Not an IP
- No underscore, no uppercase.

- **Objects (files) have key, and key is the full path.**

- **Max Object size is 5TB.**
- **If uploading file greater than 5GB, then use multi part upload.**
- **For cross account access, use bucket policy.**
- **To restrict any IAM user/group in bucket policy, specify Account ID/GroupID or Group name respectively in the Principal.**

- For anamous user - create bucket policy
- For IAM user - IAM policy
- For EC2 instance - IAM role
- Cross account access - use bucket policy

- If you delete versioned file- we can permanentlty delete that version
- IF you delete not-versioned file- then use "delete marker"
- Again we can restore this file by deleting the delete marker.



### S3 Replication:
- **CRR** (Cross Region Replication) - Buckets in Different regions
- **SRR** (Same Region Replication) - Buckets in same region.
- **Versioning must be enabled in both source and destination buckets.**
- **Asynchronous Replication** - with a delay between the original write operation and the replication process. Asynchronous replication is often used in scenarios where immediate consistency between the source and target systems isn't critical, such as in disaster recovery setups or for backup purposes.
- **After you enable replication, only new objects are replicated.**
- **If u want to replicate existing objects use, S3 batch replication.**
- There is **no chaining** in replication.

  ### S3 Versioning
- **Deleting a version is a permanent delete, where as deleting object is recoverable. You can recover the "delete marker".**
-  **Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null".**
-  **Suspending versioning will not delete the previous version.**
