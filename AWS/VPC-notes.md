## VPC 

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to create isolated virtual networks within the AWS cloud environment. Think of it as your own private section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources like EC2 instances, databases, and more, in a virtual network that you control.
