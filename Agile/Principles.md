The 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto provide guidance on implementing agile methodologies. Here they are:

1. **Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software:** Prioritize delivering functional increments of the product to provide immediate value and gather feedback early in the development process.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development:** Embrace the fact that requirements may evolve, and be prepared to adjust plans and priorities accordingly to better meet the customer's needs.

3. **Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales:** Aim for regular and incremental releases to ensure constant progress and adaptability to changing requirements.

4. **Collaborate with customers throughout the project:** Actively involve customers in the development process, seeking their feedback and ensuring the final product aligns with their expectations and needs.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals and give them the environment and support they need:** Encourage and empower motivated team members, recognizing that motivated individuals are more likely to produce high-quality work.

6. **Use face-to-face communication whenever possible:** Prioritize direct, in-person communication to enhance understanding, resolve issues quickly, and foster a collaborative environment.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress:** Focus on tangible results – the working software – as the primary indicator of project advancement rather than relying solely on plans and documentation.

8. **Maintain a sustainable pace of work for the team:** Avoid overloading team members with excessive work, promoting a sustainable pace to ensure consistent productivity and prevent burnout.

9. **Strive for technical excellence and good design:** Emphasize the importance of continuous improvement in technical skills and design to maintain a robust and adaptable codebase.

10. **Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential:** Prioritize simplicity in both the product and the process, aiming to reduce unnecessary work and complexity.

11. **Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs:** Encourage teams to self-organize and make decisions collectively, recognizing that they are best positioned to create effective solutions.

12. **Regularly reflect on and adjust the team's behavior:** Foster a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reflecting on team dynamics, processes, and outcomes, and adjusting as needed for optimal performance.
