The Agile Manifesto emphasizes four core values:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** This value underscores the importance of people and their communication within a project. It suggests that fostering effective collaboration and communication is crucial for success, rather than relying solely on tools or rigid processes.

2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Prioritizing tangible outcomes, this value encourages delivering functional software rather than excessive documentation. While documentation is essential, the focus should be on creating a working product that meets the customer's needs.

3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** This value emphasizes the importance of involving customers throughout the development process. Collaborating with customers allows for continuous feedback, ensuring that the final product aligns with their evolving requirements, as opposed to relying on rigid contracts.

4. **Responding to change over following a plan:** Agile embraces adaptability by valuing the ability to respond to changing requirements and circumstances. It acknowledges that plans may need adjustment, and flexibility is key to delivering a successful product that meets customer needs effectively.
