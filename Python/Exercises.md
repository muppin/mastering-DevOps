1. **File Reading and Writing**:
   - Create a script that reads content from one file and writes it into another file.
   - Write a script that reads a text file, modifies its content, and then writes the modified content back into the same file.

2. **File Manipulation**:
   - Create a script that renames multiple files in a directory based on a specific pattern.
   - Write a script that deletes all files with a certain file extension in a directory.

3. **File Searching and Parsing**:
   - Write a script that searches for a specific string or pattern in a text file and prints out the line numbers where the string is found.
   - Create a script that parses a CSV file and performs some data analysis, such as calculating statistics or generating reports.

4. **File Compression and Decompression**:
   - Write a script that compresses multiple files into a single zip archive.
   - Create a script that decompresses a zip archive and extracts its contents into a specified directory.

5. **File Handling with JSON and XML**:
   - Write a script that reads data from a JSON file, manipulates the data, and then writes it back to the file.
   - Create a script that parses an XML file and extracts specific information from it.

6. **File System Monitoring**:
   - Write a script that monitors a directory for any changes (e.g., file creations, modifications, deletions) and logs these changes to a text file.
   - Create a script that periodically checks the size of a file and alerts the user if the file size exceeds a certain threshold.

These examples cover a range of file operations and provide good practice for working with files in Python. Feel free to modify and expand upon these scripts based on your interests and learning goals.
