Creating a CI/CD pipeline for a 3-tier web application involves several steps. This 3-tier architecture typically includes a front-end, a back-end, and a database. Here’s a high-level outline for setting up a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Set Up Version Control**:
   - Use a version control system like Git.
   - Organize your repository to separate concerns (e.g., separate directories for front-end, back-end, and infrastructure code).

2. **CI/CD Tool Selection**:
   - Choose a CI/CD tool such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, or Azure DevOps.

3. **CI Pipeline**:
   - **Code Checkout**: Check out the code from the repository.
   - **Build**: Build the front-end (e.g., using npm or yarn for a React app) and the back-end (e.g., using Maven or Gradle for a Spring Boot app).
   - **Test**:
     - **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests for both front-end and back-end.
     - **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests to ensure components work together.
   - **Static Analysis**: Perform static code analysis (e.g., ESLint for front-end, SonarQube for back-end).

4. **Artifact Management**:
   - Store build artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR files) in a repository (e.g., Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, Docker Hub).

5. **CD Pipeline**:
   - **Deployment Stages**: Define stages like Development, Staging, and Production.
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage infrastructure.
   - **Deploy**:
     - **Development Environment**: Deploy the application to the development environment.
     - **Automated Tests**: Run automated tests (e.g., end-to-end tests) in the development environment.
     - **Staging Environment**: Deploy to the staging environment for further testing and stakeholder review.
     - **Production Environment**: Deploy to the production environment.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Set up monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) to track application performance and issues.

7. **Notifications**:
   - Configure notifications (e.g., Slack, email) for build and deployment status.

Here’s a more detailed example using Jenkins as the CI/CD tool and Docker for containerization:

### Example Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

1. **Jenkins Setup**:
   - Install Jenkins and required plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Pipeline).

2. **Jenkinsfile**:
   - Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the root of your repository to define the pipeline.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID = 'dockerhub-credentials'
        REPO_URL = 'your-repo-url'
        FRONTEND_IMAGE = 'your-frontend-image'
        BACKEND_IMAGE = 'your-backend-image'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build Frontend') {
            steps {
                dir('frontend') {
                    sh 'npm install'
                    sh 'npm run build'
                    sh 'docker build -t $FRONTEND_IMAGE .'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build Backend') {
            steps {
                dir('backend') {
                    sh './gradlew build'
                    sh 'docker build -t $BACKEND_IMAGE .'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                dir('frontend') {
                    sh 'npm test'
                }
                dir('backend') {
                    sh './gradlew test'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Push Images') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', DOCKER_CREDENTIALS_ID) {
                        sh "docker push $FRONTEND_IMAGE"
                        sh "docker push $BACKEND_IMAGE"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Development') {
            steps {
                // Deployment logic for development environment
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/development'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                // Deployment logic for staging environment
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/staging'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            steps {
                // Deployment logic for production environment
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/production'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Notifications, cleanup, etc.
            echo 'Pipeline finished'
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Docker and Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - **Docker**: Create Dockerfiles for both front-end and back-end applications.
   - **Kubernetes**: Create Kubernetes manifests (e.g., Deployment, Service) for each tier and environment.

### Dockerfile Example (Backend)

```dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY build/libs/your-backend-app.jar /app/app.jar

# Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the app
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Kubernetes Manifest Example (Backend Deployment)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: your-backend-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          value: "your-database-url"
```

This setup provides a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for a 3-tier web application, ensuring that each component is built, tested, and deployed efficiently.
